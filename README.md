# MT940Parser
A parser for the SWIFT MT940/MT942 format

## Description
This project implements a parser for the *SWIFT MT940* and *MT942* formats used for electronic banking (e.g. for electronic statements). The result is parsed into a developer friendly object model for further processing or storing.

**Do note**: This project is part of a small housekeeping book I am currently implementing for my own personal use. It may therefore be incomplete and/or faulty. If you have corrections or suggestions, please let me know.
